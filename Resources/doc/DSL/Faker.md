This bundle provides a reference resolver that is powered by the Faker library.

You can use it to dynamically generate random text, email addresses, dates and much more.

It supports the following syntax:

        faker:someProvider
        
        faker:aProviderWithParameters(a, b)

The full list of available providers is documented at https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker
